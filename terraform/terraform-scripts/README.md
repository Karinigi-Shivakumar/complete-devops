# Terraform - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Tool

Terraform is a tool for provisioning and managing infrastructure as code. It maintains the state of the infrastructure using two key files: `terraform.tfstate` and `terraform.tfstate.backup`.

---

### **State Management Files**

#### `terraform.tfstate`
- Created during the first execution of a Terraform script and updated on every subsequent run.
- Essential for Terraform to track resources during operations such as `apply`, `destroy`, or `plan`.
- Compares the actual state in the cloud/provider with the desired state defined in the configuration to determine changes.

#### `terraform.tfstate.backup`
- Stores the last known good state of the infrastructure.
- Acts as a backup in case the primary `terraform.tfstate` file is corrupted or deleted.

### **Terraform vs. Ansible for Infrastructure Provisioning**

| **Aspect**                 | **Terraform**                                            | **Ansible**                                             |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                | Primarily used for **provisioning** infrastructure (e.g., creating servers, databases, networks). | Primarily used for **configuration management** (e.g., installing software, managing services). |
| **State Management**       | Uses a **state file** (`terraform.tfstate`) to track infrastructure changes. | Stateless; does not maintain a record of past actions.  |
| **Idempotency**            | Ensures idempotency through its state file, applying only necessary changes. | Idempotency is achieved through playbook logic but without tracking infrastructure state. |
| **Execution**              | Executes in a **declarative** style: you describe the desired end state, and Terraform determines the actions. | Executes in a **procedural** style: tasks are defined step-by-step in the order of execution. |
| **Language**               | Uses **HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)** for configuration. | Uses **YAML** for playbooks and configurations.         |
| **Orchestration Scope**    | Focuses on infrastructure orchestration, typically used for cloud environments. | Focuses on software provisioning and configuration management. |
| **Tooling**                | Works with cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP for infrastructure automation. | Works with both local machines and servers for software deployment and management. |
| **Agent Requirement**      | **Agentless**; communicates directly with cloud provider APIs. | **Agentless**; uses SSH or WinRM to manage nodes.       |

### **Key Takeaways**
- Use **Terraform** when you need to provision infrastructure such as VMs, networks, or cloud resources.
- Use **Ansible** when you need to configure or manage existing infrastructure, such as installing applications or setting up services.

Both tools can complement each other in DevOps workflows: Terraform provisions infrastructure, and Ansible manages the configuration and application deployment.
